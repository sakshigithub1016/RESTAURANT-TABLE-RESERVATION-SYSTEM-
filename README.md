# RESTAURANT-TABLE-RESERVATION-SYSTEM-

The **Restaurant Table Reservation System** is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It facilitates table booking and clearing operations within a restaurant setting. 

The system consists of a matrix representing the restaurant's seating arrangement, where users can input their name and select a table to book or clear. Input validation ensures that users choose valid table selections within the defined seating matrix.

Functions include:
- **Book Table**: Allows users to book a table by entering their name and selecting a table row and column.
- **Clear Table**: Enables users to clear a previously booked table by selecting its row and column.

Dynamic label updating ensures that the GUI reflects real-time changes in table status, with tables displayed in different colors to indicate availability (light blue) or occupancy (light coral).

The GUI provides an intuitive interface for restaurant staff to manage table reservations efficiently, enhancing customer service and dining experience.
